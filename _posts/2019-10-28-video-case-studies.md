<p>Time-based media, such as video and motion graphics, can be effective ways to communicate a completed project as a portfolio project. Sometimes called video essays, video case studies can be used for a variety of contexts, such as documenting the design process for a creative project to be included as part of a portfolio, sharing the workflow of product design to communicate services and features, and even as a required part of the application process when applying to art schools.</p>
